# Welcome to my Capstone Project!


Here is my capstone project from June/July 2021, created during the neuefische bootcamp "Java Fullstack Development".
My app is called "wordsmith", a tool for language learners who already have a good command of a language but want to improve
and expand their vocabulary even further. Wordsmith helps to turn passive vocabulary into active vocabulary
by practicing words with fun mini games.
